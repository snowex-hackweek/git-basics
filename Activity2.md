# Git branches: Activity 2

[Video of me doing the activity](https://youtu.be/zVqED82u84c)

Update changes on main into your branch.

1. Make a change to main that is not on the branch. If others are did activity 1, then their changes will already be in the main branch. If not, make a change that is not on your branch (like a new file) and commit it to main.
2. Switch to your branch
    * Click the little Git icon on left
    * Click little arrow showing 'main'
    * Click on your branch
3. Look at the difference between the branches in terminal. Replace `eli` with the name of your branch.
    * `git rev-list --left-right --pretty=oneline eli..main`
4. Merge main into your branch
    * Git > Merge Branch > select `main`
