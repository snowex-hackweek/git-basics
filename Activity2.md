# Git branches: Activity 2

Update your branch from changes in main.

1. If you made any changes to main, stage and commit the change or revert the changes. *this step is important before you switch branches*
2. Switch to your branch
    * Click the little Git icon on left
    * Click little arrow showing 'main'
    * Click on your branch
4. Create a new file, text or markdown or notebook.
5. Save it with a unique name, e.g. I will call mine `eli.md`
6. Stage and commit the change. *this step is important before you switch branches*
7. Switch back to the main branch (JupyterHub might complain if your file is open. Just close it)
8. Merge your branch
    * Git > Merge Branch > select your branch
9. Look at status in terminal
    * `git status`
    * `git log`
