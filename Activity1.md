# git-basics
A repository we will all contribute to during the Git Basics tutorial

## Activity 1

All of this activity is in JupyterLab

1. Copy the URL of this repo
2. Using the URL, clone this repo in JupyterLab
3. Create a branch. 
    * Click the little Git icon on left
    * Click little arrow showing 'main'
    * Click New Branch
    * Give it a name. I will call my branch `eli`
4. Create a new file, text or markdown or notebook.
5. Save it with a unique name, e.g. I will call mine `eli.md`
6. Stage and commit the change. *this step is important before you switch branches*
7. Switch back to the main branch (JupyterHub might complain if your file is open. Just close it)
8. Switch back to your branch
