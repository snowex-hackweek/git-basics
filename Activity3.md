# Git branches: Activity 3

See what happens on the JupyterHub when you have uncommitted changes and switch branches.

1. If you made any changes to main, stage and commit the change or revert the changes. *this step is important before you switch branches*
2. Switch to your branch
    * Click the little Git icon on left
    * Click little arrow showing 'main'
    * Click on your branch
3. Edit your file, save and do NOT commit the change.
4. Switch to the main branch.
5. Look at your file. You will see the changes you made on the branch.
6. Switch to your branch
7. Stage and commit your change.
8. Switch back to the main branch.
9. Now you don't see the change.


Note is "following" behavior before committing on a branch is specific to Git on the JupyterHub. It is a setting in the Git config and you won't necessarily have this behavior when you use Git in other places. Note you can easily change this behavior by issuing a `git config` command.
